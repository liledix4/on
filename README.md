There are two other concepts that make this particular repository pointless.

1. I'm making entire repositories about relatively complicated subjects. Some of them are:

     - https://github.com/liledix4/ahaha
     - https://github.com/liledix4/past

     Both are currently in production.

3. There's a new idea of project. It already has the repository:

     - https://github.com/liledix4/ask

   This project is secret. Yet the idea alone is replacing some aspects of this "on" repository with some twist.
